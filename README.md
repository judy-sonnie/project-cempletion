### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### The Data

In the folder `zippedData` are movie datasets from:

* [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)
* [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
* [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)


### My analysis

#### Questions to be answered
1) what are the genres with the highest rate ranking and the lowest ranking
2) what are the genres with the highest and lowest gross income
3) does the rankings affect the gross income
4) what are the genres to venture into and the ventures to avoid according to my insight

#### steps in my Data analysis

1) Data Selection; selection of the datasets used, and that includes the im.db and bom.movies_gross.csv
2) Data Tidying and Cleaning ; cleaning of datasets by eg, removing missing values, duplicates and null values
3) Data analysis ; checking through cleaned data for useful information
4) Data visualization ; representation of my insights to bar graphs

#### Reccommendation
1) The Adventure, Documentary, Comedy-Drama are among the highest ranked genres with number of votes from IMDB hence it is best if Microsoft ventures in the  genres.
2) The Comedy, Drama-history and Horror-Drama are the least ranked and thus we should avoid venturing into those genres .
3) The higher the rankings the higher the higher the gross, and hence that means we can venture into my top rate rankings.
